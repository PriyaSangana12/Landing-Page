    <h2>LANDING PAGE</h2>
    <p>
      A <b>Landing Page</b> is a standalone web page, created specifically for a
      marketing or advertising campaign.
    </p>
    <p>
      Itâ€™s this focus that makes landing pages the best option for increasing
      the conversion rates of your marketing campaigns and lowering your cost of
      acquiring a lead or sale.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have created the landing page of <b>"Find your dream vehicle"</b>related
      to modern vehicles like bikes, cars, thar, etc.
